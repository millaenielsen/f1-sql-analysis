# f1-sql-analysis


Formula 1 is the number one motorsport in the world generating billions of dollars a year in revenue. Each
season only the top 20 best drivers and 10 best constructors complete for the championships. Thus with very
few highly competitive spots, understanding what it means to be a winning driver could mean the difference
between keeping your position for next season and having to find a new career. In this repo I
will use SQL in conjunction with R to explore what factors go into being a winning driver. I will investigate
the impact of constructors and individual drivers statistics as well other factors to begin to understand why
certain outcomes occur in races.
